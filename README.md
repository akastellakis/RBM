# Restricted Boltzmann Machines 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) inspired by the foundational work and insights from Geoffrey Hinton.

## Table of Contents

- **Introduction:** An overview of RBMs.

- **Historical Background:** Explore the historical context from Hopfield networks to RBMs.

- **RBM Structure:** Understand the structure and components of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine, including visible and hidden units.

- **Training an RBM (Theoretical Background):** Dive into the theoretical aspects of training an RBM, including the concepts of energy-based models and contrastive divergence.

- **Coding Our Own RBM (Creating an RBM Class):** Step-by-step guide on creating a Python class for RBMs, complete with code explanations.

- **Learning the MNIST Digits:** Apply your newly acquired knowledge by training an RBM on the MNIST dataset to perform tasks like feature learning and generative modeling.

## Getting Started

To get started with this RBM implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Restricted Boltzmann Machines.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook.

3. Follow along with the code and explanations in the notebook to learn about RBMs and experiment with them.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

Install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
